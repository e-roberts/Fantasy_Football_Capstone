# Fantasy Football Capstone Project


### Data Science Capstone project on Fantasy Football


This repository documents my failed attempts to connect to the Yahoo! Fantasy Sports API. At first, I attempted to connect directly to the API by following the example of GitHub user Brian Benbenek ["@bbenbenek"](https://github.com/bbenbenek/nfl-fantasy-football). While his instructions were helpful, I was unable to get the API to download the data to a JSON file correctly, so I searched for an API wrapper that could help. Aspired by the work of GitHub user ["@uberfastman"](https://github.com/uberfastman/yfpy/), I next attempted to follow his instructions on how to utilize the YFPF wrapper he created to connect to the Yahoo! Fantasy Sports API. However, I faced numerous coding errors in following the instructions, eventually leading me to abandon connecting to the API entirely. Eventually, I was able to download a data set from [Fantasy Data](https://fantasydata.com/) from the 2021-2022 Season and created a website of Tableau Data Visualizations that can be viewed [here](https://github.com/e-roberts/Fantasy_Football_Capstone).
